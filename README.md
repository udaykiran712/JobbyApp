Constructed an all-in-one job searching platform, Jobby App.

● Built pages for Login, Home, Jobs, and Job item details with React components, form inputs, and event handlers.
● Ensured secure authentication with JWT tokens and REST API calls.
● Persisted login state with cookies and protected routes with React Router.
Technologies used: React JS, JS, CSS, Bootstrap, Routing, REST API Calls, Cookies, JWT Token, Authorization, Authentication.

PROJECT INTRO: 

I have developed an online job searching application called Jobby App. I developed it using React in a week. It allows users to browse through a list of job offers, apply filters, search jobs and view detailed information about each job. I implemented a basic authentication flow and handled common errors such as invalid username and invalid password. I used cookies to persist user credentials across page reloads. I used React Router for navigation within the application. Additionally, I implemented protected route to control access for the routes. I used the component lifecycle to fetch data from APIs when a component was mounted. Since my primary focus was building the frontend part of the application, I integrated mock APIs for the data. I have also performed filter-specific API calls using query parameters to the Mock API and displayed the filtered results. I used conditional rendering to display different components based on the API status. During the API request, I displayed a loading spinner from the third party package, react loader spinner. If the API request fails, I have provided a retry button. When the retry button is clicked, another GET request is triggered to retrieve the data from the mock API. I followed clean code guidelines by maintaining a consistent folder structure and used meaningful naming conventions, such as prefixing event handlers with on and creating reusable components throughout the application. To ensure a responsive design, I used media queries and flexbox for layouting. In the future, I plan to develop a backend for the app to provide a more comprehensive experience. This would allow for features like user registration, and saving favourite jobs.
